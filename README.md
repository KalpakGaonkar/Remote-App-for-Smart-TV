# Remote-App-for-Smart-TV

## Summary
<p align="justify">The main problem that customers face when buying a smart TV is that users often must use a different remote when using applications on the smart TV. The goal of this project is to build a remote that functions as a universal remote and can be used to operate all applications on the smart TV with ease. The remote must be an Android or iOS application that makes it convenient for TV owners to download the application with just a click. The mobile application must be intuitive and easy-to-use and must pair with all smart TVs.</p>


Here are some mockups I have made using FIGMA
